g++ -c hello.cpp
source.cpp => compile => object.o => link => executable hello or a.out

if it does not return anything, you did it right
but that does not mean your program works, it just means it compiled.

g++ -c hello.cpp
=> compile, don't look for main, it could be somewhere else

-pedantic
-Wall

./a.out
